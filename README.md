# init
This project is an introduction to system administration and networking, proposed by the /16 team.

## Goals
This first project, init, will give me the opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.
